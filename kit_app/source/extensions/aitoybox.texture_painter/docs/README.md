# AI Texture Painter [aitoybox.texture_painter]

AI Texture Painter is an Omniverse extension that enables artists to texture paint on the surface of 3D meshes directly using reference images.
Using AI, our texture brush can generate seamless strokes with realistic transitions between textures.
This extension does not include the AI model inference. The AI model must be launched separately.
